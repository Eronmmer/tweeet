# Tweeet

## What is this?

A very minimal CLI tool that lets you send out tweets from the comfort of your terminal.

## Why did you build this?

I got tired of always opening twitter on my browser or iPhone to tweet.

## Any plans for the future?

I could add a bunch of features like viewing the timeline, viewing the latest tweets from a user, sending DMs, etc. Feel free to open a PR if you have any ideas!
